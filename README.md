With over a hundred hours of work poured into this project, we present to you: Lost Memories

​

Lost Memories is a game that utilizes an immersive first person 3D escape room style experience to provide a captivating experience towards the reality of what it’s like to have a memory linked cognitive disease. It outlines a nuanced look at what it truly means to be a patient of dementia and progressively dissociate from reality through aspects such as changing rooms, room codes changing, and doors you thought you opened being closed for an intense escape room style experience.

IMPORTANT

Make sure to read all of the clipboards for the full experience of the game!
